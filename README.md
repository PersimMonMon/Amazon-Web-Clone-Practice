Main idea of JavaScript
    1. Save the data
    2. Generate the HTML
    3. Make it interactice
        
        -data is the information about our products
            -example: for amazon we created an array to store objects that contain info about the product 
        
        -.toFixed allows us to set how many decimals we want 
        -order of scripts going into html matters!

How do we know which product to add? 
    DATA ATTRIBUTE 
        -just another HTML attribute
        -allows us to attach any information to an element 
        -has to start with "data-"
        -then give it any name 
        -use .dataset to get all attributes starting with data- 

Note: includes() only work on arrays or strings
